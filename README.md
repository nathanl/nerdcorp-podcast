# Ten Gallon Chat

Name courtesy of Chris Aquino. :D

## General Idea

- Regular chat between developers, kinda like what one hears on [The Bikeshed](http://bikeshed.fm/)
- 2-3 developers per episode.
- Frequency: undecided
- Not super long - 30 min or less per episode. 5min is OK if it's good.
- Signature feature: every episode features one *planned* explanation of a technical topic by a host or guest. It doesn't have to be huge or in-depth, as long as there's something concrete that the listener would learn. Examples:
  - The various kinds of constraints you can use in PostgreSQL and what they're good for.
  - Why prepared database statements are good for security and performance, and when ActiveRecord and Ecto do/don't use them.
  - Technical strengths and weaknesses of Elixir.
  - Public vs private vs protected methods in Ruby and what the point is when you can always use `.send`
  - Why do you always have to validate data on the server even if you have great client-side validations
  - Why / how is JSON API useful and/or what are the downsides (if any).
  - How some Git stuff works?
  - ?? Your ideas here!! ??

## The Plan

Let's record one episode, share it internally, and decide whether to continue!

## How we'll record

- We start a video/audio hangout, probably via https://appear.in/some-room-name-of-our-choosing
- Each participant records their own audio using something like [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)
  - Tip: do not use your laptop's mic - it will sound like you're on speakerphone and we'll get a ton of background noise. A USB headset would be OK. A fancy USB mic would be better.
- Afterwards, all audio files are sent to me and I combine them, do some editing, add fancy intro music, etc
